# Ansible_Playbooks

Hello everyone, I am Garnier Edouard. Here is the repository where I plan to put all the ansible playbooks that I did during my advanced technician exam and during my internship.

While they may be old depending on the date that you are using this github repository, I'm sure they will become a great example or learning experience for people searching for playbook examples.
